president: Mr. Inspector, I'm the kind of good boss who has a lot of trust in my employees. Good old Mike, I've known him for a long time. He's never let me down! He puts in hours and hours, and you know the best part? He doesn't even ask for overtime!
president: If we didn't have a night watchwoman, I'm sure he would just sneak in at night just for the pleasure of working some more! Hehe.
president: Also, I have to show a humility: I let the professionals do their job, while I do mine. Counting bills and smoking cigars is just as technical, you know?
