president: Mr. Inspector, I'm the kind of good boss who has a lot of confidence in my employees. Good old Mike, I've known him for a long time. He's never let me down! He puts in hours and hours, and you know the best part? He doesn't even ask for overtime! I wouldn't be surprised if he even hid in the office during Mandy's night shift.
Secondly, I have to show a little humility: I let the professionals do their job, while I do mine. Counting bills and smoking cigars is just as technical, you know?
