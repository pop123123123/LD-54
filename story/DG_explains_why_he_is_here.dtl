inspector: What are you doing at this hour sir?
dark_groomer: What are you doing here? Go back to sleep, you'll throw off your sleep cycle, old man.
inspector: Answer my question, kid.
goomer: Well, I'm working, what else do you want me to do?
inspector: What's that funny machine you're using?
dark_groomer: Uh... It's a dog-brushing machine. Princess' hair got stuck in it. I'm in charge of cleaning it. Why do you want me to do that? Are you interested?
inspector: Remember to sleep... Otherwise, you won't last as long in the profession as I have.
dark_groomer: That's it, that's it, let me work!
