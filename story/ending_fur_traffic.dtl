sheriff: Good old Larry, back already?
inspector: Sheriff, I've got my hands on a big fish!
sheriff: So this Pascal Pala? Murdered? Runaway? Accident?
inspector: Well...
sheriff: Larry, don't tell me you've forgotten...
inspector: To tell you the truth, I didn't get to the bottom of it...

sheriff: Guns?!

And so ended Limited Larry's investigation at Jazzy Jaws Grooming. The Sheriff's crew arrested the entire salon for undeclared activity. Princess Christine de-la-Fourri√®re pulled the short straw and was hanged for the example.
She was given a posthumous grace in 2078.
No one ever found out what happened to Pascal Pala...
