president: Oh, what is that sweet, sweet girl up to? I am glad you didn't see me earlier, I spent half the day crying my eyes out. I just laid in fetal position on my desk, and cried and cried and cried.
president: To think that, this dog, this sweet little dog, could have a slightly bad day... I can't imagine it. That's not right. That's just not right. Why should such an innocent creature be made to suffer!
inspector: You're right, that's awful.
president: Usually, when I walk around the shop and she sees me, she always rubs against my leg, a way of saying hello... But today, she saw me, she just barked at me. I tried throwing myself out of my office window, but I am on the ground floor.
inspector: It's a bit worrying, but I guess you have a good heart.
