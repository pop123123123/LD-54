president: Our intern Pascal is nowhere to be found. The little guy worked a lot for me, and I was under no legal obligation of paying him, on account of him being an intern. I haven't heard from him since yesterday.
president: We've looked everywhere: in the kennel cages, in the storage room cupboards, ... I pray every single day since it happened for him to return to us in one piece.
president: I hope there is a heaven for interns, he certainly deserves at least that.
