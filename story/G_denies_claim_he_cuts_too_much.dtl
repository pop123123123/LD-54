groomer: HOW DARE YOU! I CUT THE HAIR OF MY PATIENTS NEITHER TOO SHORT NOR TOO LONG, BUT JUST RIGHT! DOG STYLING IS AN ART, AND YOU ARE A PROFANE.
groomer: YOU ARE BOTH IGNORANT AND ARROGANT. YOUR PARENTS SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HAVING RAISED AN IMPOLITE BRAT SUCH AS YOURSELF. OR IS IT THAT YOU FORGOT YOUR GOOD MANNERS ALONG WITH THE NAMES OF YOUR GRANDCHILDREN?
groomer: I WORKED HARD TO END UP WHERE I AM. I SWEAT BLOOD AND LIVED IN THE STREETS FOR 5 YEARS! I FOUGHT FOR YOUR LIBERTY DURING THE REVOLUTION! AND THIS IS HOW YOU THANK ME!
groomer: SHOW SOME GRATITUDE, YOU WRINKLY BUFFOON! CAN'T YOU SEE THAT YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT? THIS IS NOT YOUR CENTURY, GRANDPA!
groomer: NEVER CALL ME AN INCOMPETENT! I CAN'T ARGUE AGAINST SUCH AN ACCUSATION SO I WILL KEEP HURLING INSULTS FOR HOURS!
groomer: I WILL SUE YOU! I WILL SUE YOUR CHILDREN! I WILL SUE THE CHILDREN OF YOUR CHILDREN! I WILL SUE THE DOG OF THE BEST FRIENDS OF THE CHILDREN OF YOUR CHILDREN!
groomer: GO AWAY, YOU EXPIRED BABOON! YOU DISCOUNT DERRICK! GO, GO OUT AND FIND YOURSELF A NICE DITCH TO DIE IN, JUST FAR AWAY FROM MY VIEW.
groomer: Sorry, that last part may have been a bit excessive.
groomer: I will still sue your grandchildren, though.
