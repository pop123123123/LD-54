groomer: I found this human forearm in the corridor two days ago. I put it in a plastic bag because it started smelling. Do you believe that it may be related with the vanishing of the intern?
investigator: Let me see... Yes, that is a possibility we should keep in mind.
groomer: Oh look, it has a tattoo on the wrist. It says "I am having an affair with the CEO's wife".
investigator: Intriguing...
groomer: I think that the intern had one just like that.
investigator: Hmmm... Makes me wonder... Could it be?
groomer: What do you mean, inspector? What did you deduce.
