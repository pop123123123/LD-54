janitor: What are you investigating, again?
inspector: An intern disappeared. You didn't know?
janitor: It does ring a bell. I don't remember many things because I am a rasta and some of the substances I occasionally come in contact with tamper with my memory.
inspector: Trust me, you don't need the substances to reach this result. Patience, young man.
inspector: You don't seem to have slept much.
janitor: I just stayed up late. Praising Jah and getting fiyah takes time, man.
