janitor: What are you investigating, again?
investigator: An intern disappeared. You didn't know?
janitor: It does ring a bell. I don't remember many things because I am a rasta and some of the substances I come into contact with tamper with my memory.
investigator: Trust me, you don't need the substances to reach this result.
investigator: You don't seem to have slept much.
janitor: I just stayed up late. Praising Jah and getting fiyah takes time, man.
