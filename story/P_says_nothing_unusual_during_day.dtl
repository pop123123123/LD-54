president: What? Fur trading? Here? Are you joking? I think that you are joking. Let me laugh\: Haha.
president: Ha.
president: No, it can't be. I'm extremely involved in the life of this company and I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary. Everything is under control.
president: My employees are also extremely vigilant about any activity that could compromise our reputation. You don't get two and a half stars on Schloogle Schnaps by accident!
