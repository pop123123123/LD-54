dark_groomer: Congrats inspector
inspector: I beg you pardon?
dark_groomer: You've just discovered that I like Lucy Lullaby. What a feat! I don't think I have the discretion of a pachyderm though...
inspector: I think I detect sarcasm.
dark_groomer: Let me get on with my work, I've had enough of your questions formulated by a decrepit mind.
inspector: Watch your tone young man, remember you could be my grandson!
