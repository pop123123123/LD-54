receptionist: Princesse spent the night in the kennel, I am not aware of anything unusual. Why do you ask?
inspector: Your client said that something was wrong about her dog this morning. She seems to think that her dog is traumatized. She declared that she won't come back.
receptionist: Oof. I knew it was bad, but not that bad. The client came this morning and she asked to talk to my manager. I didn't hear the finer details. That's disastrous!
inspector: Why is this disastrous, there are plenty of fish in the sea, right?
receptionist: I wish. We used to have plenty of customers, but these times are gone. We're losing our old customers, and we have trouble finding new ones.
inspector: Why could that be?
receptionist: I have overheard several clients saying that their dogs came back almost bald. But that can't possibly account for all of it.
inspector: I see.
