night_warden: Seriously? Richie? Vegan? Let's be serious...
inspector: What makes you say that?
night_warden: Richie is a hot dog freak. It's all he talks about, all he lives for. Since he finishes late, I run into him at the beginning of the shift, and he often insists that we go and taste the famous hot dogs from the butcher's shop next door.
night_warden: A vegan Richie is like a broke Grill Grates or a paid intern...
