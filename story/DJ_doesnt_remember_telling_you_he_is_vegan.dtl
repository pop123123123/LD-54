janitor: Jah blessed me with a hot dog, man.
investigator: Wait, are you not vegan?
janitor: Usually yes, but hot dogs are my guilty pleasure.
investigator: That doesn't make much sense.
janitor: Alright, I confess everything! I am not really a rasta, I just pretend to be one becase it makes me different and therefore cool.
investigator: What about the murder?
janitor: Hey man, fiyah bun. I didn't murder no brother.
