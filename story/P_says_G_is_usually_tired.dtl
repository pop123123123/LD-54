president: Haha, that is just good old Mike "kills himself at work" Bitterbark behavior. He's never let me down! He puts in hours and hours, and you know the best bit? He doesn't even ask for me to pay his overtime! I wouldn't even be surprised if he hid in the office while Mandy was on night shift.
president: Anyway, the poor devil works himself to the bone, and I'm very grateful to him for that. But I'm going to tell him to ease off a bit, because I don't want to alienate the unions.
