customer: Hmpf... Yes, I sometimes leave Princesse Christine de-la-Fourrière in the kennels at night when I have to go to dinner with the Colonel and the Prosecutor... Princesse doesn't really like the kennels, does she, Princesse?

customer: Oh no! I bring Princesse Christine de-la-Fourrière here because she's always the only one in the kennel! A dog with such talent needs space to express all her beauty.
