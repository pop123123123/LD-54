customer: Hmpf... Yes, I sometimes leave Princess in the kennels at night when I have to go to dinner with the Colonel and the Prosecutor... Princess doesn't really like the kennels, does she, Princess?
inspector: What's the problem? Do the other dogs bark in English?
customer: Oh no! I bring Princess here because she's always the only one in the kennel! A dog with such talent needs space to express all her beauty.
