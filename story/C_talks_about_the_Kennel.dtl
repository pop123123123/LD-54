customer: Hmpf... Yes, I sometimes leave Princesse Christine de-la-Fourrière in the kennel at night, when I have to go to dinner with the Colonel and the Prosecutor... Princesse doesn't really like the kennel, do you, Princesse?
inspector: What's the problem? Do the other dogs bark in English?
customer: Oh no! I bring Princesse Christine de-la-Fourrière here because she's usually the only one in the kennel! I wouldn't want her to mix with mongrels and strays.
