dark_groomer: You came back tonight to tell me that?
inspector: Well... That's information I remember, so let's make the most of it.
dark_groomer: What do you want me to say, old man? Would you like me to go into more detail?
dark_groomer: If you must know, I sometimes sneakily cut locks of her hair that I store in my wallet, and I drink from her dirty coffee cup... How's that, inspector? If you think I'm a creep, you clearly never have been in love.
inspector: Humpf, well, that's enough, I don't want to know any more.
