groomer: I don't know, this is sad stuff.
inspector: You don't say. Do you know who could have any reason to kill the intern?
groomer: Alright, alright, I confess everything. I murdered that intern in cold blood!
inspector: !!!
groomer: Just kidding.
inspector: Please don't do this again, I'm not certain that my pacemaker can keep up.
groomer: To answer your question, no, I don't know who could have been angry at the intern. As far as I know, everyone liked the guy. Especially the boss' wife.
