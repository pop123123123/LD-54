inspector: Is that a tropical disease?
groomer: No, it's a place where you can freeze your dog shortly before their death. That way, maybe a future civilization will come along, unfreeze your dog and extend its life.

groomer: If I were an advanced civilization, I wouldn't spend my time unfreezing dogs. But money is money, what do you want.
