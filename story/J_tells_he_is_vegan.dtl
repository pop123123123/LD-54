janitor: Jah bless brother!
investigator: Hello, young man. I'm from the police.
janitor: I'm clean man! It's only CBD, I swear!
investigator: Praise Jah, bretta. I am not your enemy.
janitor: Yes I, you speak well for an agent of Babylon!
investigator: I spent eight years infiltrating extremists groups, I am familiar with rastafari culture.
janitor: Oh no, fiyah bun man!
investigator: It's ok, I never arrested innocents. None that I remember, that is. If all you do is eat vegan food with CBD sauce, you should be safe.
janitor: Yes I, I am indeed vegan bretta: no meat, no cheese, no eggs, no fish, no leather, no milk, ... You name it, I don't eat it.
