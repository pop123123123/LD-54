president: Richie is the kind of vegan who preaches terribly well for his chapel. He once threw a bucket of pig's blood in my face while I was eating my ham sandwich. Hahaha, good old Richie. I admit I was almost convinced but... I love my wife too much to go vegan you know...
inspector: I don't quite see what that has to do with anything, Mr Chairman.
president: Oh you know, she loves saus... Er... Anyway, do you need anything else?
