night_warden: Ah... ahem... Yes, of course, good evening Inspector! I've been looking forward to seeing you. Please, take a seat, I'll make you a nice cup of coffee.
inspector: No, thank you, charming lady. No coffee tonight, I might not be able to sleep. You young people don't realize it, but it could shorten my life expectancy by a few weeks, which, on my scale, is quite a lot.
night_warden: You're right, Inspector, let's be reasonable. My name is Mandy Moonlight, I'm the warden of Jazzy Jaws Grooming.
