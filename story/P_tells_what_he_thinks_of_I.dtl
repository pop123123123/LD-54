president: Pascal? Pascal is an inspiration! I love to think of him as my son. He means the world to me. You know, I've always wanted to have children, but with my wife right now, it's a bit complicated in the bedroom...
inspector: I heard enough. Thank you, I understand that this young man really meant a lot to you.
president: I also like the fact that he has been such a faithful employee even though I haven't payed him a single cent in the last five years. Bless this country and its exploitative internship laws. This is why I love democracy!
inspector: Hmm.
