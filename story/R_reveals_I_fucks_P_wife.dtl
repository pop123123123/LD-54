receptionist: I found this human forearm discarded in some bin two days ago. I put it in a plastic bag because it started smelling. Do you believe that it may be related with the vanishing of the intern?
investigator: Let me see... Yes, that is a possibility we should keep in mind.
receptionist: Oh look, it has a tattoo on the wrist. It says "I am having an affair with the CEO's wife".
investigator: Intriguing...
receptionist: I think that the intern had one just like that!
investigator: Hmmm... Makes me wonder... Could it be?
receptionist: What do you mean, inspector?
