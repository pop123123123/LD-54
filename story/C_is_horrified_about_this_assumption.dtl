customer: Inspector, you've got to put a stop to this despicable traffic! My poor Princesse Christine de-la-Fourri√®re! This birdbrained receptionist and this terrible groomer are both monsters! Monsters!
inspector: Everything is under control, Mrs Du Canin, please remain calm.
customer: Sit down!
inspector: I am the police officer, Madam. With all the respect your rank inspires, I am the one who can give orders here.
customer: I was talking to my dog. The world doesn't revolve around you, mister.
