president: Of course, you're the police inspector. What was I thinking? Please, have a seat. Can I get you some coffee?
inspector: Thanks for the offer, but I will have to pass on the coffee. My doctor has forbidden me for some time now - he says it's bad for my digestion. I have to be careful around laxative substances - I'm not 65 anymore!
president: How can I help you?
inspector: Well, see, I'm here about the fire incident.
president: The fire?
inspector: Or was it a kidnapping?
president: Inspector... I have lost my favorite intern, and I need you to find him for me. I know nothing about any fire incident!
